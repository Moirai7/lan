My goal is to address cybersecurity problems leveraging AI, focusing on attacks and defenses against deep learning-based detection models. 
I'm a PhD candidate in Information Science and Technology at Penn State University. I obtained my master's degree at Tsinghua University working on the privacy-preserving encoding mechanism and malware detection based on deep learning. My interned experiences included Big data Analysis at Baidu in Beijing.
