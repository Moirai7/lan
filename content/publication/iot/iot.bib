abstract = {Emulating firmware of microcontrollers is challenging due to the lack of peripheral models. Existing work finds out how to respond to peripheral read operations by analyzing the target firmware. This is problematic because the firmware sometimes does not contain enough clues to support the emulation or even contains misleading information (e.g., a buggy firmware). In this work, we propose a new approach that builds peripheral models from the peripheral specification. Using NLP, we translate peripheral behaviors in human language (documented in chip manuals) into a set of structured condition-action rules. By checking, executing, and chaining them at run time, we can dynamically synthesize a peripheral model for each firmware execution. The extracted condition-action rules might not be complete or even be wrong. We, therefore, propose incorporating symbolic execution to quickly pinpoint the root cause. This assists us in the manual correction of the problematic rules. We have implemented our idea for five popular MCU boards spanning three different chip vendors. Using a new edit-distance-based algorithm to calculate trace differences, our evaluation against a large firmware corpus confirmed that our prototype achieves much higher fidelity compared with state-of-the-art solutions. Benefiting from the accurate emulation, our emulator effectively avoids false positives observed in existing fuzzing work. We also designed a new dynamic analysis method to perform driver code compliance checks against the specification. We found some non-compliance which we later confirmed to be bugs caused by race conditions.},
